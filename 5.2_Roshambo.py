ROSHAMBO PROGRAM
----------------

Create a program that randomly chooses a 1, 2, or 3.
Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors using if statements. Don't select from a list.
Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice as well as if they want to quit.(1 for rock, 2 for paper, 3 for scissors and 4 for quit)
I don't want to be asked to quit each time. I will enter a 4 if I want to quit.
Add conditional statements to figure out who wins and keep the records
Each round tell me what the computer chose, what I chose and also if I won, lost or tied.
When the user quits print an end game message and their win/loss/tie record
